Status: 

Added 3D navigation (WASD) as well as a 'mini-cam' in the upper left corner, so that the user can view the surrounding environment while in a virtual one.

Mini-cam will show potentially detected objects with a red square around them. Every n cycles, a 3D object will be placed in the game where a real object is believed to be.

To do: Refine object recognition/ placement
